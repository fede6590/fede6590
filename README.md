### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Federico, Iâ€™m 32 years old, born and raised in France and currently living in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I'm finishing my Sound Engineering program and I've just got my ML Engineer Certificate at Anyone AI (+650 hours of training).

Iâ€™ve spent these last months developing AI projects like Deep Learning applied to Image Classification, segmentation, NLP projects or even more classical Machine Learning. All this implementing dockerized micro-services architecture, Flask-APIs and deploying on AWS servers. My last project was an Object Detection project for in-store inventory management using Convolutional Neural Network for detect missing articles based on images, very Retail Industry oriented.

More related to my background, I have a couple of years of experience programing in MATLAB and Python which Iâ€™ve used to build an Impulse Response software for acoustic measurement & characterization of a room, and a Kalman Filter to predict audio signals in noisy environment. I also have experience with sounds systems installations and tutoring math, algebra & physics to high school students.
