### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Audio Engineering with +4 years of experience and specializing in Machine Learning (+1 year). Iâ€™ve completed multiple projects using Python, Numpy, AWS, Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Docker and the basics in SQL among others. I also have +4 years with Python applied to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Audio. I had a chance to mentor students in applied mathematics, algebra and physics, in addition to my experience in commercial audio consulting. 

Iâ€™m a lifelong learner and enjoy working on projects where I can apply my skills while learning new technologies. I consider myself a self-taught individual, problem-solving oriented, and enjoy collaborating with a team.
